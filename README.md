# Profiler Generator

## Description
The following application is a command-line application that will create a profile file based off user input.  In order to use the application, a user
would have to navigate to where the "index.js" file is located and open up their terminal.  The application can be started by typing the following command in the
terminal and pressing the "enter" key:

```sh
node index.js
```

The user will then be prompted with a series of questions regarding their GitHub username and choice of favorite color.  Once complete, a personal profile will be generated
with the user's information and responses.

## Technologies
This application uses the following: Node.js, Axios, Dotenv, and Inquirer.

## Experiences
Building this application was a challenge. One part I struggled in was figuring out how I was going to generate a pdf file, but I eventually found a solution by examining some of the experiences I had with solutions during class activities and drills. I simply applied some of class techniques and what I know in order to apply it succesfully to this project.  Another challenge was being able to combine data from two different sources for use in generating the html file.  Through this experience, I learned more about using packages from npm, using an async function, and modularizing my application.
